checkpolicy (1.30.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * checkpolicy_1.30.10-1(ia64/unstable): FTBFS: missing build-depends?
    Actually, no.  the package asks for bison -- but it is not around, so
    Make just picks yacc as default (which is also missing). So I think
    this is a buildd bug -- but there is no harm in being a little more
    robust, and being able to prove it is not a package bug is bonus.
